## Vertical (New and Old Website):

Vertical is helping the health care institutions with their IT services. I worked in this project on a very tight deadline. They were looking for a fast and optimized landing page to boost their services. I provided them with a fresh landing page within just 4 days. After that they have planned to update their website after delivering the first version. They have added blog and cornerstone pages with a fully furnished â€˜About Usâ€™ page. The plan was to make home page static and other pages (Blog, Cornerstone, About us) dynamic. So, user will experience a fast loading as the website loads. For this, I used the getStaticPaths, getStaticProps functions of NextJS to integrate Contentful data with Frontend to build dynamic content pages.

## Saturna Marketplace: 
Saturna is a cryptocurrency based web application. It is introducing a P2P NFT Marketplace, one of the first of its kind and with a following of over 70,000 holders. 
Their slogan is: Buy and hold Saturna to enjoy its frictionless yields in a community-driven project. 

I've worked on the frontend development part (React.js) of their NFT marketplace. The designs were provided in Figma which was converted to re-usable React components by me. In this project, typescript was used and all the data were typed which helped the Web3 developer to integrate smoothly. As, there are multiple dynamic pages, so React suspense was also used to load the pages lazily. Also, the components were broken into small functional ones to re-use through the application.
