## Vertical:

Vertical is helping the health care institutions with their IT services. Their mission is to help Patient-Centric Digital Health Go Global.<br/>

At first, I worked in this project on a very tight deadline. They were looking for a fast and optimized landing page to boost their services. I provided them with a fresh landing page within just 4 days. <br/>

After that, they had planned to update their website after delivering the first version. For the new site, I build it from scratch. For a better expereience, I made the Home page as static site and made other pages (Blog, Cornerstone, About us) dynamic. So, users experience a fast loading when the website loads. This is the main marketing tool for Vertical now and it's boosting their business daily.

<br/> This is not just a static site. I had integrated Contentful CMS with Frontend to build dynamic content pages. SEO is also implemented on the site. Also, to achieve both static and server side rendered pages, I used the getStaticPaths, getStaticProps functions of NextJS.

<br/> The whole site is developed by me from scratch. The client provided me the design on AdobeXD and from that I made the site alive.

## Techspecs:

An API First Search Engine For Standardized Consumer Electronics Technical Specifications. <br/>

I worked with the team for implementing a new feature. There were tasks to show all brands, categories and specification of different types of gadgets in an app. Also, there were two UIs to create a new specification and a new schema to create such specification. This was a full stack Next.js app where I had handled both the frontend and backend logic codes. As there were a lot of products, I had implemented Algolia search too in the application

They approached me to build their new marketing site with Vue.js and Vuetify. I worked closely with the stakeholders to design, build and test the website. This is a multi page website with dynamic and static content. They had provided me design on Figma and from there I developed the site. In some cases I put my own decision to make it better and user friendly. The site has been delivered with template pages. They are working on it now and not live yet. But, for testing purpose it's deployed on Netlify.

## Saturna Marketplace:

Saturna is a cryptocurrency based web application. It is introducing a P2P NFT Marketplace, one of the first of its kind and with a following of over 70,000 holders.
Their slogan is: Buy and hold Saturna to enjoy its frictionless yields in a community-driven project.

I worked on the frontend development part (React.js) of their NFT marketplace. The designs were provided in Figma which was converted to re-usable React components by me. In this project, typescript was used and all the data were typed which helped the Web3 developer to integrate smoothly. As, there are multiple dynamic pages, so React suspense was also used to load the pages lazily. Also, the components were broken into small functional ones to re-use through the application.
